#Titans Girls Basketball
â€“ It was an exciting wrap-up to the basketball season this past February, as our girls team battled hard through City play-offs.  The Bantam Girls (Gr.8) finished off their season with an exciting, yet nail-biting loss against Lord Byng.  The Sr. Girls (Gr.11/12) made a strong comeback during play-offs beating Van Tech to secure a 5th spot place in the City finals.  Our Jr Girls (Gr.9/10) won their way to the City Championship, facing a strong Britannia team and taking home 2nd.  It was a fantastic year of basketball from all of our Titan teams!  Players - congratulations on your seasons, your teamwork and on representing Templeton with pride! Go TITANS!
