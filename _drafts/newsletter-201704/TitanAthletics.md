# Titan Athletics
As the Winter Season draws to a close let us take this opportunity to recognize some of the memorable and noteworthy achievements of our basketball teams. We showcased 6 basketball teams [senior boys 10/11/12, juvenile boys 9, bantam boys 8, senior girls 11/12, junior girls 9/10, and bantam girls 8] all of whom competed diligently and laid the foundation for promising years ahead. Honourable mention goes out to our junior girls who placed 2nd in the Vancouver City Championships earning a silver medal and representing our school admirably. Kudos! The season was capped off in an exciting afternoon of basketball with a staff/student game followed by an alumni/senior boys game. In closing let us take the opportunity to recognize all of our volunteer coaches and team sponsors, scorekeepers, officials, team managers, and community leaders whose selfless contributions make athletics sustainable and enriching at Templeton. GO TEMP!
