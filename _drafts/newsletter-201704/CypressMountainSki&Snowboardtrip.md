# Cypress Mountain Ski & Snowboard Trip
Templeton took to the slopes for their second day of program-based riding this season at Cypress Mountain.  It was a snowy winter wonderland, and although visibility was lost in the clouds, the stashes of powder were easy to find!  Well done skiers & riders on getting out to enjoy an active day in the mountains!
